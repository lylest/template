# Full-Stack MERN Template

![MERN Logo](https://your-image-url.com)

Welcome to the Full-Stack MERN Template! This repository serves as a starting point for building modern web applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Whether you're a beginner looking to learn MERN or an experienced developer who wants to kickstart a new project, this template provides you with a solid foundation to begin with.

## Features

- Full-featured backend with Node.js and Express.
- Robust frontend with React and Redux for state management.
- User authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- MongoDB for scalable and flexible database management.
- Bootstrap for responsive and mobile-friendly UI design.
- RESTful API design to communicate between frontend and backend.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

- Node.js (version 12 or above)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB (Make sure MongoDB is installed and running locally or provide a remote connection URI)

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/lylest/template.git
```

2. Install backend dependencies:

```
cd template/backend
npm install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder and define the following variables:

```
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-uri
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-for-jwt
```

4. Run the backend server:

```
npm start
```

5. Install frontend dependencies:

```
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

6. Run the frontend development server:

```
npm start
```

Your application should now be up and running! Access it by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Folder Structure

The template follows a common MERN folder structure:

- `backend`: Contains all the backend code.
- `frontend`: Contains all the frontend code.

## Backend Scripts

- **start**: `node index.js`

- **dev**: `nodemon index.js`
  - Start the backend server using nodemon in development mode, which automatically restarts the server when changes are made to the files.

## Frontend Scripts

- **start**: `react-scripts start`
  - Start the frontend development server.
  
- **build**: `react-scripts build`
  - Build the production-ready frontend application.
  
- **test**: `react-scripts test`
  - Run tests in the frontend application.
  
- **eject**: `react-scripts eject`
  - Eject from the Create React App configuration, allowing customization of webpack and other build tools.
